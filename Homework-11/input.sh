echo "Hi, my name is $1, and I'm $2 years old. Every morning, $1 likes to spend time $4.
As a $2-year-old, I believe it's never too late to follow your dreams. My favorite programming language is $3.
I code in $3 almost every day!
One day, I hope my love for $3 will help me achieve my dream of $5.
When I'm not busy working toward $5, you'll find me $4 to relax.
That's a little about me, $1 â€” a $2-year-old who loves $3, enjoys $4, and dreams of $5!"
